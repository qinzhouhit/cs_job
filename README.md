### Intro to CS job seeking

This is a short summary of my personal job seeking experience., including industrial jobs like SDE, MLE, research/applied scientist (RS), and data scientist (DS).

### Key points
1) For PhD, the first priority should always be publishing first-authored top conference papers, e.g., NeurIPS, SIGIR, WWW, KDD, AAAI, ACL, EMNLP, CVPR, etc.
2) PREPARE AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE!!! Coding, ML design, system design, the effort/ time you pay finally determines your level.
3) Find an internshinp, not any internshinp, the internshinps which can become return offers. It makes it much easier if you want to work in big (any) companies, and it completely changes your job searching (if you still want to search for more).
4) If no return offer, then it becomes hard. It is hard since you have to interview for several rounds to obtain an offer, any mistake you made during any round can terminate your application; it is hard since you may also need to compete with experienced candidates; it is hard since you have to be really good so one can hire you for a full-time position without working with you before.

### Preparation
In short, one needs to prepare from a few perspectives, despite your own research/ industrial experiences.

1) Resume/CV. Send it to different people or pay to get it polished.
2) LeetCode (SDE, MLE, RS, DS). Resources: LeetCode, Youtube, GeeksforGeeks
3) System Design (SDE, RS). Resources: Grokking the System Design Interview, projects
4) Machine Learning Design (RS, MLE, DS). Resources: Grokking the Machine Learning Interview, Kaggle, projects
5) Others, e.g., SQL, statistics, probability, etc.
