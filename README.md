### Intro to Computer Science job search

This is a short summary of my personal job search experience., including industrial jobs like SDE, MLE, research/ applied scientist (RS), and data scientist (DS).

### Key points
1) For PhD, the top priority should always be publishing first-authored top conference papers, e.g., NeurIPS, SIGIR, WWW, KDD, AAAI, ACL, EMNLP, CVPR, etc. Decent publication records can even bring the jobs to you.
2) PREPARE AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE!!! Coding, ML design, system design, the effort/ time you pay finally determines your level (total compensation/ money).
3) Find an internshinp, not any internshinp, the internshinps which can become return offers. It makes it much easier if you want to work in big (any) companies, and it completely changes your job search (if you still want to search for more).
4) If no return offer, then it becomes hard. It is hard since you have to interview for several (usually >= 4) rounds to obtain an offer, any mistake you made during any round can terminate your application; it is hard since you may also need to compete with experienced candidates; it is hard since you have to be really good so one can hire you for a full-time position without working with you before.

### Preparation
In short, one needs to prepare from a few perspectives, despite your own research/ industrial experiences.

1) Resume/ CV. Send it to different people or pay to get it polished.
2) LeetCode (SDE, MLE, RS, DS). Resources: LeetCode, Youtube, GeeksforGeeks.
3) System Design (SDE, RS). Resources: Grokking the System Design Interview, projects.
4) Machine Learning Design (RS, MLE, DS). Resources: Grokking the Machine Learning Interview, Kaggle, projects.
5) Others, e.g., SQL, statistics, probability, etc. 

### Application
1) Directly go to the recruiter or hiring manager, if possible, e.g., LinkedIn InMail.
2) Find employers who can refer you.
3) Apply directly (inefficient but it works after applying for hundreds of positions).

### Interview
1) Check the historical interview questions online.
2) Check with people having experience interviewing with the target companies.
3) Prepare for the basics (inefficient but it works after spending hundreds/thousands of hours)

### Job level
One can apply for New Grad roles or entry level roles with <= 3 years of experience required. 

1) SDE: one can try roles explicit marking as New/ Univeristy Grad.
2) DS: both new grad and entry level roles are fine.
3) RS/AS: no new grad version, you compete with experienced/PhD candidates.
4) MLE: usually they want someone with industrial experience as SDE/ MLE. 

### Pure research roles
Just in case one is interested, there are certain PURE research roles (research + publishing paper) in certain companies, such as Spotify, Salesforce, Alibaba DAMO, Deepmind, NEC, Dataminr, etc.
