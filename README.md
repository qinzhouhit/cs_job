# Intro to CS job seeking

I.e., industrial jobs like SDE, MLE, research/applied scientist (RS). Data scientist (DS) is another topic though.

One-liner: prepare as EARLY as possible! Data structures, ML design, system design, the more time you spend on them, the more benefits you will receive in the future.

Just some personal summary, more related to PhD or experienced masters. In short, one needs to prepare from three perspectives, despite your own research/ industrial experiences.

2. System Design (SDE, RS)

3. Machine Learning Design (RS, MLE)
