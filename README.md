### Intro to CS job seeking

This is a short summary of my personal job seeking experience., including industrial jobs like SDE, MLE, research/applied scientist (RS), and data scientist (DS).

### Key points
1) PREPARE AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE!!! Data structures, ML design, system design, the effort/ time you pay finally determines your level.
2) Find an intern, not any intern, the interns which can become return offers. This is much easier if you want to work in big names.
3) If not intern, then it becomes hard. It is hard since you have to interview for several rounds to obtain an offer; it is hard since you may also need to compete with experienced candidates.

### Preparation
In short, one needs to prepare from three perspectives, despite your own research/ industrial experiences.

1) LeetCode (SDE, MLE, RS, DS). Resources: LeetCode, Youtube, GeeksforGeeks
2) System Design (SDE, RS). Resources: Grokking the System Design Interview, projects
3) Machine Learning Design (RS, MLE, DS). Resources: Grokking the Machine Learning Interview, Kaggle, projects
4) Others, e.g., SQL, statistics, probability, etc.
