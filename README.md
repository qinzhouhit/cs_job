# Intro to CS job seeking

I.e., industrial jobs like SDE, MLE, research/applied scientist (RS). Data scientist (DS) is another topic though.

One-liner: PREPARE AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE!!! Data structures, ML design, system design, the effort/ time you pay determines your level.

Just some personal summary, more related to PhD or experienced masters. In short, one needs to prepare from three perspectives, despite your own research/ industrial experiences.

2. System Design (SDE, RS)

3. Machine Learning Design (RS, MLE)
